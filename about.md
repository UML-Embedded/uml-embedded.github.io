# About Me
---

My names Patrick, I’m a Junior Computer Engineering Undergraduate at University of Massachussets Lowell. I'll be graduating next spring, and whether I feel like getting a higher degree is still up in the air. This site's home to my Blog, Project Write-Ups, and whatever else in the world I’m in the mood to post.

I currently work at UMass Lowells' Human-Robot Interaction(HRI) Lab under Professor Holly Yanco. Check that out [here](http://robotics.cs.uml.edu/). I did my Co-Op at Philips Medical, where I was part of the test engineering team.

In my free time I enjoy climbing, running, lifting, Brazilian jiu jitsu, and coming up with project ideas that I eventually abandon because I come up with an *"even cooler"* new one.
