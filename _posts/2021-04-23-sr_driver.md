A quick writeup of a ROS based driver for the soft robotic gripper, and the UR series arms.  
Can be found here: <https://github.com/PatrickCPE/sr_driver>  

# Background
Soft Robotics developed this pretty sick pneumatic based gripper, but the control depends on the UR Pendant attached to the UR5 arm we use.
This is extremely cumbersome, and it doesn't work with the automated grasping system we have developed at our lab.  
After initial attempts at writing an entire TCP communication library I discovered a pretty well written and well documented library for the UR series robots Real Time Data Exchange Interface (RTDE) in UR_RTDE.

# SR_Gripper State Machine
In this state machine the message represents the +24V digital inputs into the codrive pneumatic pump system.  
The digital signals are created via the UR5's control box's. Bit 1 is D1, 2 is D2, 3 is D3.  
It should be noted that you only remain in these states for a certain period of time depending upon the pressure the system's ADC reads.  
The below state diagram shows the basic concept.

Ignoring the neutral state which isn't exactly useful in my particular use case you can simplify this quite a bit.  
Note the state machine ignores the pressure requirements for each state.  
After determine these through the precision technique of guessing and checking (intelligently of course ) I wrote up a ROS package that can handle this.  
After dealing with some strange type casting issues that totally didn't nearly blow up this $1000 gripper the package worked.

# Using the Package
* Ensure that the pinout corresponds to your install of the SR Gripper (Analog Input 0, and Digital 0,1,2 in our case)
* Modify the code to support your installation pinout
* Update the voltage bounds to whatever grasp bounds you want (this was the guess and check portion done via the UR Pendant)
* If updating the voltage bounds update the watchdog timer, so it corresponds properly

When all of that is done it's pretty simple
* roscore
* rosrun sr_driver sr_driver.py

Publish your desired state as a string to /sr_gripper

* rostopic pub /sr_gripper std_msgs/String "data: 'open'"  
* rostopic pub /sr_gripper std_msgs/String "data: 'closed'"
